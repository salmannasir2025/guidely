## Local Development Setup

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Python 3.11+
- Docker Desktop (recommended)
- Access to a MongoDB Atlas cluster, Redis instance, and the required Google Cloud APIs.

### 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/salmannasir2025/guidely.git
cd guidely

### 2. Backend Setup
The backend is a FastAPI application located in the api/ directory.
Step A: Create and Activate Virtual Environment

### Navigate into the API directory
cd api

### Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

### Activate the environment
### On Windows (PowerShell):
.\\.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1

### On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
Step B: Install Dependencies

### Ensure your virtual environment is active
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Step C: Configure Environment Variables
The application requires API keys and connection strings to run. These are managed via a .env file for local development.
Create a file named .env inside the api/ directory.
Copy the contents of api/.env.example into your new api/.env file.
Fill in the actual values for each variable.

### Required Variables:

Variable	Description
GEMINI_API_KEY	Your API key for the Google Gemini LLM.
SERPAPI_API_KEY	Your API key for the SerpAPI web search.
MONGO_URI	The full connection string for your MongoDB.
REDIS_URL	The connection URL for your Redis instance.
FRONTEND_URL	The local URL of the frontend (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5500) for CORS.
Note: The .env file is listed in .gitignore and will never be committed to the repository.

### Step D: Run the Backend Server
### From the 'api/' directory with the virtual environment active:
uvicorn index:app --reload
The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000. You can view the interactive documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

### 3. Frontend Setup
With the backend running, you can now launch the vanilla JS frontend.
Open with a Live Server:
The easiest way to run the frontend is with a live server extension (like "Live Server" in VS Code).
Right-click the frontend/index.html file and choose "Open with Live Server". This handles CORS issues automatically.

### Open Directly:
Alternatively, navigate to the frontend directory in your file explorer.
Open the index.html file directly in a modern web browser.
The application should now be fully functional on your local machine.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This application is configured for continuous deployment to **Fly.io**. Any push to the `main` branch will automatically trigger the deployment workflow defined in `.github/workflows/fly-deploy.yml`.
